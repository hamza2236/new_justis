The User is informed that any infringement of image rights, respect for private life or professional and medical secrecy may be subject to sanctions, including criminal penalties. In the event of a malfunction of any kind whatsoever during the Teleconsultation, the User must immediately inform the professional. The User who improperly interrupts the Teleconsultation engages his responsibility with regard to the professional. At the end of the Teleconsultation, the Legal Professional confirms the amount to be paid by the User.
